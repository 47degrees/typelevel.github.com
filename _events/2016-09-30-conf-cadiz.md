## About the Conference

A day of Typelevel sessions, co-located with [Lambda World](http://www.lambda.world).

On Friday, September 30th,[Lambda World](http://www.lambda.world) will host a Typelevel Unconference during the morning and a few workshops in the afternoon. The day will conclude with a community dinner where attendees can discuss functional concepts while enjoying Flamenco music.

If you're interested in speaking during the unconference, please send us your ideas. This is just to see what people are interested in. There is no review, the actual sessions are decided at the conference! We will publish all the submitted proposals here.
