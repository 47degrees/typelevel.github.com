## About the Summit

The second Typelevel Summit will be co-located with <a href="http://2016.flatmap.no/">flatMap(Oslo)</a>.

The Summits are open to all, not just current contributors to and users of the Typelevel projects, and we are especially keen to encourage participation from people who are new to them.
Whilst many of the Typelevel projects use somewhat "advanced" Scala, they are a lot more approachable than many people think, and a major part of Typelevel's mission is to make the ideas they embody much more widely accessible.
If you're interested in types and pure functional programming we'd love to see you here!

## Call for Speakers

The Summit will feature both 30 minute and 15 minute-long talks.
We will announce a first batch of talks starting March 8th, considering proposals submitted until March 1st.
But don't worry: If you missed that date, you've still got time to submit a talk.
The final deadline for proposals is April 3rd (anywhere on Earth).

We are looking for a variety of topics; including, but not limited to:

- Experience reports:  "How we migrated our code base to shapeless"
- Typelevel project updates: "What's new in Typelevel project X"
- Your project updates: "What's new in X", where X uses Typelevel heavily
- Big picture: "Where is Scala headed for typed FP?"
- Tutorial-style: "Error-handling with cats", "Idiomatic ScalaCheck"
- Tooling: "We can now use Ensime in Notepad"
- Related work: "How language X does typed FP and what we could learn"
- Non-tech issues: "Diversity in the Scala community", "Governance in Typelevel"

Proposals should be related to the Typelevel family in some way or follow the Typelevel spirit.
