## About the Summit

The second Typelevel Summit will be co-located with <a href="http://2016.flatmap.no/">flatMap(Oslo)</a>.

## Call for Speakers

The Summit will feature both 30 minute and 15 minute-long talks.
The Call for Speakers is joint with the <a href="/event/2016-03-summit-philadelphia/">Philadelphia Summit</a>.
Talks for the Oslo Summit are accepted until April 3rd.

We are looking for a variety of topics; including, but not limited to:

- Experience reports:  "How we migrated our code base to shapeless"
- Typelevel project updates: "What's new in Typelevel project X"
- Your project updates: "What's new in X", where X uses Typelevel heavily
- Big picture: "Where is Scala headed for typed FP?"
- Tutorial-style: "Error-handling with cats", "Idiomatic ScalaCheck"
- Tooling: "We can now use Ensime in Notepad"
- Related work: "How language X does typed FP and what we could learn"
- Non-tech issues: "Diversity in the Scala community", "Governance in Typelevel"

Proposals should be related to the Typelevel family in some way or follow the Typelevel spirit.
