## About the Summit

LambdaConf takes place the week of May 22, in Boulder, Colorado.
While the actual conference takes place May 26â€“28, the whole week is packed full of activities you may be interested in.

Wednesday, May 25 there will be a one-day Typelevel Summit.
Talks and workshops will take place from 9am to 5pm with pizza provided for lunch by LambdaConf.

For more information about the conference, visit <a href="http://www.lambdaconf.us/">lambdaconf.us</a>.

The Summits are open to all, not just current contributors to and users of the Typelevel projects, and we are especially keen to encourage participation from people who are new to them.
Whilst many of the Typelevel projects use somewhat "advanced" Scala, they are a lot more approachable than many people think, and a major part of Typelevel's mission is to make the ideas they embody much more widely accessible.
If you're interested in types and pure functional programming we'd love to see you here!
