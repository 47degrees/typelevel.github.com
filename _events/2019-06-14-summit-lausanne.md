## About the Summit

The eight Typelevel Summit will once again be co-located with Scala Days.
Read more about all events in the <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2019/01/17/scala-days-2019-celebrating-collaborative-success.html">blog post</a> from the Scala Center.

## Call for Speakers

The Summit will feature both 30 minute and 15 minute-long talks.

We are looking for a variety of things! Possible topic ranges include, but are not limited to:

  - Experience reports:  "How we migrated our code base to shapeless"
  - Typelevel project updates: "What's new in Typelevel project X"
  - Your project updates: "What's new in X", where X uses Typelevel heavily
  - Big picture: "Where is Scala headed for typed FP?"
  - Non-code issues: "Diversity in the Scala community", "Governance in Typelevel"
  - Tutorial-style: "Error-handling with cats", "Idiomatic ScalaCheck"
  - Tooling: "We can now use Ensime in Notepad"
  - Related work: "How language X does typed FP and what we could learn"

Proposals should be related to the Typelevel family in some way or follow the Typelevel spirit.

**We welcome all sorts of talks!** You don't have to write down a perfect abstract. **Submissions by first-time speakers are especially welcome!**
