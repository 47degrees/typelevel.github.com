## About the Summit

The first Typelevel Summit will be co-located with the <a href="http://www.nescala.org/">Northeast Scala Symposium</a> in Philadelphia.
There will be one day of recorded talks and one day of unconference.

The Summits are open to all, not just current contributors to and users of the Typelevel projects, and we are especially keen to encourage participation from people who are new to them.
Whilst many of the Typelevel projects use somewhat "advanced" Scala, they are a lot more approachable than many people think, and a major part of Typelevel's mission is to make the ideas they embody much more widely accessible.
If you're interested in types and pure functional programming we'd love to see you here!

_Call for Speakers is now closed!
Stay tuned while we prepare the programme._
