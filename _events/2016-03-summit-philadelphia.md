## About the Summit

The first Typelevel Summit will be co-located with the <a href="http://www.nescala.org/">Northeast Scala Symposium</a> in Philadelphia.
There will be one day of recorded talks and one day of unconference.

The Summits are open to all, not just current contributors to and users of the Typelevel projects, and we are especially keen to encourage participation from people who are new to them.
Whilst many of the Typelevel projects use somewhat "advanced" Scala, they are a lot more approachable than many people think, and a major part of Typelevel's mission is to make the ideas they embody much more widely accessible.
If you're interested in types and pure functional programming we'd love to see you here!

## Call for Speakers

The Summit will feature both 30 minute and 15 minute-long talks.
The Call for Speakers is joint with the <a href="/event/2016-05-summit-oslo/">Oslo Summit</a>.

The final deadline for proposals is January 31st (anywhere on Earth).

We are looking for a variety of topics; including, but not limited to:

- Experience reports:  "How we migrated our code base to shapeless"
- Typelevel project updates: "What's new in Typelevel project X"
- Your project updates: "What's new in X", where X uses Typelevel heavily
- Big picture: "Where is Scala headed for typed FP?"
- Tutorial-style: "Error-handling with cats", "Idiomatic ScalaCheck"
- Tooling: "We can now use Ensime in Notepad"
- Related work: "How language X does typed FP and what we could learn"
- Non-tech issues: "Diversity in the Scala community", "Governance in Typelevel"

Proposals should be related to the Typelevel family in some way or follow the Typelevel spirit.

## Venue

This event will take place at Hub's Cira Centre, next to 30th Street Station.

Plan to hang around after the Typelevel Summit, because this year, the <a href="http://www.nescala.org/">Northeast Scala Symposium</a> will be held at the same location on March 4th and 5th.
RSVPs open January 16th.
