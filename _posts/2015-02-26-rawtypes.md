Why you can’t implement that Java method in Scala
=================================================

Or, **“existential types are not raw types”**.

Scala makes a *welcome* simplification in its type system: type
arguments are always required.  That is, in Java, you may (unsafely)
leave off the type arguments for compatibility with pre-1.5 code,
e.g. `java.util.List`, but Scala does not permit this, and requires
you to pass an argument.

The most frequent trouble people have with this rule is being unable
to implement some Java method with missing type arguments in its
signature, e.g. one that takes a raw `List` as an argument.  Let us
see why, and why this is a good thing.

Existentials are safe, raw types are not
----------------------------------------

Stripping the type argument list, e.g. going from
`java.util.List<String>` to `java.util.List` is *an unsafe cast*.
*Wildcarding* the same type argument, e.g. going from
`java.util.List<String>` to `java.util.List<?>`, is *safe*.  The
latter type is written `java.util.List[_]`, or `java.util.List[T]
forSome {type T}`, in Scala.

```java
abstract class TestEx {
    public static List<String> words() {
         return new ArrayList<>({"hi", "there"});
    }

    // TODO warning
    public static final List wordsRaw = words();

    // there is no warning for this
    public static final List<?> wordsET = words();
}
```

Also note that there is no warning for the equivalent to `wordsET` in
Scala.

```scala
scala> TestEx.words
TODO

scala> val wordsET = TestEx.words : java.util.List[_]
TODO
```

Raw Types are bad.  Stop using them
-----------------------------------

The reason that existentials are safe is that the rules in place for
values of existential type are consistent with the rest of the generic
system, whereas raw types contradict those rules, resulting in code
that should not typecheck, and only does for legacy code support.  We
can see this in action with two Java methods.

```java
public void addThing(final List xs) {
    xs.add(42);
}

public void swapAround(final List<?> xs) {
    xs.add(42);
}
```

These methods are the same, except for the use of raw types versus
existentials.  However, the second does not compile:

TODO error

Why forbid adding 42 to the list?  The element type of list is
unknown.  The answer lies in that statement: *its unknownness isn’t a
freedom for the body of the method, it’s a restriction*.  The rawtype
version treats its lack of knowledge as a freedom, and the caller pays
for it by having its data mangled.

```java
public void testIt() {
    final List<String> someWords = words();
    addThing(someWords);
    System.out.println("Contents of someWords after addThing:");
    System.out.println(someWords);
    System.out.println("Well that seems okay, what's the last element?");
    System.out.println(someWords.get(someWords.size() - 1));
}
```

And it compiles:

TODO output

But when we try to run it:

```scala
scala> TestEx.testIt()
TODO error
```

It is a mistake to think that just because some code throws
`ClassCastException`, it must be to blame for a type error.  This line
is blameless.  It is the fault of the unchecked cast when we called
`addThing`, and more specifically, the unsafe assumption about the
`List`’s element type that was made in its body.

Existentials are much better
----------------------------

When we used the wildcard, we were forbidden from doing the unsafe
thing.  But what kinds of things can we do with the safe, existential
form?  Here’s one:

```scala
public void swapAround(final List<?> xs) {
    xs.add(xs.get(0));
}
```

In other words: let `E` be the *unknown* element type of `xs`.
`xs.get()` has type `E`, and `xs.add` has argument type `E`.  They
line up, so this is okay, no matter what the element type of `xs`
turns out to be.  Let’s try a test:

```scala
scala> val w = TestEx.words
TODO
scala> TestEx.swapAround(w)
TODO
scala> w.get(w.size - 1)
TODO
```

The body of `swapAround` is guaranteed not to mangle its argument by
the type checker, so we, as a caller, can safely call it, and know
that our argument’s type integrity is protected.

Crushing the existential
------------------------

Let’s consider the `xs.get()` and `xs.add` methods, which have return
type and argument type `E`, respectively.  As you can’t write the name
of an existential type in Java, what happens when we “crush” it,
choosing the closest safe type we can write the name of?

First, we can simplify by considering every existential to be bounded.
That is, instead of `E`, we think about `E extends Object super
Nothing`, or `E <: Any >: Nothing` in Scala.  While `Object` or `Any`
is the “top” of the type hierarchy, which *every* type is a subtype
of, `Nothing` is the “bottom”, sadly left out of Java’s type system,
which *every* type is a *supertype* of.

For `get`, the `E` appears in the result type, a *covariant* position.
So we crush it to the upper bound, `Any`.

```scala
scala> wordsET.get _
TODO
```

However, for `add`, the `E` appears in the argument type, a
*contravariant* position.  So it must be crushed to the lower bound,
`Nothing`, instead.

```scala
scala> wordsET.add _
TODO
```

Each occurrence of an existential in a signature may be crushed
independently.  However, a variable that appears once but may be
distributed to either side, such as in a generic type parameter, is
*invariant*, and may not be crushed at that point.  That is why the
existential is preserved in the inferred type of `wordsET` itself.

```scala
scala> wordsET
TODO
```

Herein lies something closer to a formalization of the problem with
raw types: they crush existential occurrences in contravariant and
invariant positions to the upper bound, `Object`, when the only safe
positions to crush in this way are the covariant positions.

How do `List` and `List<?>` relate?
-----------------------------------

It is well understood that, in Java, `List<String>` is not a subtype
of `List<Object>`.  In Scala terms, this is because all type
parameters are *invariant*, which has exactly the meaning it had in
the previous section.  However, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to
draw subtyping relationships between different `List`s for different
type arguments; they must merely be mediated by existentials, as is
common in the Java standard library.

The basic technique is as follows: we can convert any `T` in `List<T>`
to `? extends T super T`.  Following that, we can raise the argument
to `extends` and lower the argument to `super` as we like.  A `?` by
itself, I have described above, is merely the most extreme course of
this formula you can take.  So `List<T>` for any `T` is a subtype of
`List<?>`.  (This only applies at one level of depth;
e.g. `List<List<T>>` is not necessarily a subtype of `List<List<?>>`.)

Does this mean that `List` is a subtype of `List<?>`?  Well, kind of.
Following the rule for specialization of method signatures in
subclasses, we should be able to override a method that returns
`List<?>` with one that returns `List`, and override a method that
takes `List` as an argument with one that takes `List<?>` as an
argument.  However, this is like building a house on a foam mattress:
the conversion that got us a rawtype wasn’t sound in the first place,
so it doesn’t seem worth fully supporting the implications.

The frequent Java library bug
-----------------------------

Let’s see the specific problem that people usually encounter in Scala.
Suppose `addThing`, defined above, is a member of `TestEx`:

```java
class TestEx2 extends TestEx {
    @Override
    public void addThing(final List<?> xs) {}
}
```

Or the Scala version:

```scala
class TestEx3 extends TestEx {
  override def addThing(xs: java.util.List[_]): Unit = ()
}
```

`javac` gives us this error:

TODO

while `scalac` gives us this error:

TODO

How to fix it
-------------

1. Stop using raw types.

2. **If you maintain a Java library with raw types in its API, you are
   doing a disservice to your users.  Eliminate them.**

3. If you are using such a library, report a bug, or submit a patch,
   to eliminate the raw types.

4. Help Java projects, including your own, avoid introducing raw types
   by adding `-Xlint:rawtypes` to their `javac` options.  **`rawtypes`
   is more serious than `unchecked`**; even if you do not care about
   `unchecked` warnings, you should still turn on and fix `rawtypes`
   warnings.

You may also turn on `-Xlint:castTODO` to point out casts that are no
longer necessary now that your types are cleaner.  If possible, add
`TODO-error` to your build as well, to convert `rawtypes` warnings to
errors.

Adding wildcards isn’t a panacea.  For certain raw types, you need to
add a proper type parameter, even adding type parameters to your own
API.  It all depends on how to model your specific scenario.

Wildcards and existentials are historically misunderstood in the Java
community; Scala developers have the advantage of more powerful
language tools for talking about them.  So if you are unsure of how to
eliminate some raw types, consider asking a Scala developer what to
do.

The Scala philosophy
--------------------

As you can see, the Java compatibility story in Scala is not as simple
as is advertised.  However, I favor the strong stance against this
unsound legacy feature.  If Scala can bring an end to the scourge of
raw types, it will have been worth the compatibility trouble.
